        <h1>Spaghetti Carconara</h1>
        <section>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
       <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li>50g grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>
       <li> Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
       <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
<li>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until<br> crispy, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add it to the skillet and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
<li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
<li>Immediately add the hot spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta or bacon. Toss to combine, allowing the<br> spaghetti to heat through.</li>
<li>Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour the egg and Parmesan mixture over the hot spaghetti, stirring <br>continuously to coat the spaghetti evenly. The residual heat will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
<li>If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
<li>Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Enjoy!</li>

    <li><h4>History</h4></li>
    <ul>
        <li><h5>origin</h5></li>
        <p>The origins of spaghetti carbonara are believed to be in Rome, Italy. The dish likely emerged in the<br> mid-20th century, possibly after World War II, although the exact details are debated.
    <li><h5>theories and name</h5></li>
    <p>There are several theories about the origin of the name "carbonara." One theory<br>suggests that the dish was popular among coal miners (carbonai in Italian), who used ingredients like eggs, <br>cheese, and cured pork to prepare a hearty meal. Another theory proposes that the name is derived from "carbonaro," <br>which means charcoal burner, referencing the black pepper that resembles coal specks sprinkled throughout the dish.</p>
<li><h6>Influence of American Soldiers</h6></li>  
<p> Some culinary historians believe that spaghetti carbonara may have been influenced<br> by <q><cite>American soldiers stationed in Italy during and after World War II.</cite></q> They introduced ingredients like bacon and <br>eggs to traditional Italian pasta dishes, which could have contributed to the creation of carbonara.</p>    
<li><h6>Development of the Recipe</h6></li>
<p>The classic recipe for spaghetti carbonara typically includes ingredients such as<br> spaghetti pasta, pancetta or guanciale (cured pork cheek), eggs, grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, <br>black pepper, and sometimes garlic. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce when combined with the hot pasta, and the pancetta<br> or guanciale adds savory flavor.</p>
<li><h6>Popularity and Evolution</h6></li>
<p>Spaghetti carbonara gained popularity both in Italy and internationally due to its <br>simplicity, rich flavor, and comforting qualities. Over time, variations of the dish have emerged, with some recipes<br> incorporating cream or other ingredients, although purists argue that these additions deviate from the traditional recipe.</p>
